					<description><![CDATA[Do you ever get that feeling when you wake up early morning, test your vocals under a hot shower, make a wholesome breakfast maybe some toasted bread, an omelette and a steaming hot coffee, just ready to attack the day feeling all pumped up? Well, we need to talk man. Who are you? What are you? So positive about everything life has to offer.. &#160; Let’s rewind a little to how most of us “humans” wake up. Firstly, we hail to the Snooze lord, praying every 5 minutes feels like an hour. Shower? Well if there’s still time or the stink is unbearable😏 Breakfast is a dream we hope to achieve sometime in the future… Put on some clothes, rush to the stop trying to catch your life running away from you.. A drowsy face and a lousy place, well you chose this so you got no choice. Feeling tired already, thinking about the good old days with your teddy. Lost in the past, worried about the future while avoiding the present. Hoping for a crescent of luck coming your way, you really aren’t ready for the play. &#160; At the end of the day, there’s the usual frustration and an abundance of exasperation. Screaming, crying and dying in our own exaggeration, searching for the final salvation. Hmm.. seems kind of heavy for the very first blog, just felt like pouring my mind out because life is just a freaking slog. Well, if this is what all of you go through&#8230; Feel free to comment below and subscribe to stay tuned to this feed! #Keepitreal &#160;]]></description>
